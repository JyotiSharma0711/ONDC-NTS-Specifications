      Detailed flows covering miscellaneous or self settlements. 
      NPs share settlement instructions to the Settlement Agency 
      and the settlement agency responds with whether the settlement 
      was successful or not. In the example below, a retail seller app is sharing settlement instructions to move funds from their non operating account to their operating account and their respective provider's account.
