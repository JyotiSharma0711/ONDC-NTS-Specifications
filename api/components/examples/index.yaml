  summary: RSF 2.0
  description: |
    Reconciliation and Settlement Framework provides a comprehensive framework
    to ensure accurate and timely settlements among participants in the network.
    RSF 2.0 brings an enhanced workflow where the NPs share order-level the
    settlement instructions to the Settlement Agency (SA) which matches the same
    with the respective counterparty NP and then moves funds if the amounts have
    matched successfully.
